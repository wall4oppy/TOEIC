解析：

根據前句關鍵單字【shout at 對(某人)大吼】搭配後方【wear a smile on one's face 面帶微笑】可判斷兩句為轉折語氣，故選(A)表【雖然…(但是)】。選項(B)為因果關係句的連接詞；選項(C)表時間副詞連接詞，用來表達兩句動作發生的時間相近；而選項(D)則為假設語氣。

解析：

【in spite of/ despite】表【不論、儘管】後接名詞，而選項(A)【in spite of/ despite the fact that+S+V】後則可接子句。根據空格後方的名詞【the typhoon】可得知選項(D)為正解。選項(C)用於因果關係句；而選項(B)用來連接語氣相同的子句，但兩者意思皆與本句不符。
